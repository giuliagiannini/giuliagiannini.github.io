## About me  

I am a cosmologist working on weak gravitational lensing, galaxy–galaxy lensing, photometric redshifts, and simulation-based inference for cosmology.  
I am a member of the **Dark Energy Survey (DES)** and LSST-DESC, focusing on weak lensing and multi-probe analyses.

## Dark Energy Survey – Year 6 (Y6)  

I am the **only Italian scientist who is first author of the final DES Year 6 papers**, including two of the key cosmology analyses of the collaboration.

On **January 20**, DES will present the Y6 results in an official public webinar.  
Before the webinar I cannot discuss any scientific details, but **afterwards I will be available** to talk about:

- the final DES Y6 cosmology results  
- the role of the Italian community in DES  
- the analyses and robustness tests I led as first author  
- what these measurements tell us about dark matter and dark energy  

If you are a journalist and would like to be contacted after the webinar, feel free to reach out.
