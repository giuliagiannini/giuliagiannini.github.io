<p>
  I am a cosmologist working on the large-scale structure of the Universe, with a focus on weak gravitational lensing and galaxy–galaxy lensing. My research aims to test models of dark energy by improving the robustness of weak-lensing analyses, with particular attention to systematic uncertainties and redshift calibration in photometric surveys.
</p>

<p>
  I am currently based at ICE–CSIC in Barcelona as a Juan de la Cierva Fellow. Over the past seven years, I have been deeply involved in the Dark Energy Survey (DES), contributing to lensing measurements and redshift calibration efforts, including work toward the Year 6 analysis. I am also a member of LSST-DESC, where I contribute primarily as a photo-z expert, supporting methodological development and cross-collaboration activities.

<p>
  More recently, I joined the Euclid Collaboration, where I plan to continue working on 3×2pt analyses andrelated projects, building on my experience from DES and LSST-DESC. More broadly, I am interested in understanding how observational and modeling uncertainties propagate into cosmological constraints, and in developing analysis strategies that enable reliable tests of dark energy with current and future surveys.
