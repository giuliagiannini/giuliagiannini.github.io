    <p>
I am a cosmologist working on the large-scale structure of the Universe, with a focus on weak gravitational lensing and galaxy–galaxy lensing. My research aims to test models of dark energy by improving the robustness of weak-lensing analyses, with particular attention to systematic uncertainties and redshift calibration in photometric surveys.

I am currently based at ICE–CSIC in Barcelona as a Juan de la Cierva Fellow. Over the past seven years, I have been deeply involved in the Dark Energy Survey (DES),

contributing to lensing measurements and redshift calibration efforts, including work toward the Year 6 analysis. I am also a member of LSST-DESC, where I contribute primarily as a photo-z expert, supporting methodological development and cross-collaboration activities.

More recently, I joined the Euclid Collaboration, where I plan to continue working on 3×2pt analyses and related projects, building on my experience from DES and LSST-DESC. More broadly, I am interested in understanding how observational and modeling uncertainties propagate into cosmological constraints, and in developing analysis strategies that enable reliable tests of dark energy with current and future surveys.

This website provides an overview of my research, publications, and ongoing projects.
