My research focuses on extracting robust cosmological information from galaxy surveys, with a particular emphasis on weak gravitational lensing, galaxy–galaxy lensing, and the calibration of photometric redshift distributions. I work primarily within the Dark Energy Survey (DES), developing the methods that connect imaging data to precise cosmological measurements. My contributions span the full inference pipeline: from photometric redshift calibration (using clustering-based methods, deep-field SOMPZ, and hybrid approaches) to the validation of weak-lensing and galaxy–galaxy lensing measurements, and finally to their impact on cosmological parameters. My work aims to ensure that the cosmological conclusions drawn from DES are both statistically optimal and systematically reliable.

## Weak Lensing 

Weak gravitational lensing is the subtle distortion of galaxy shapes caused by the gravitational field of the large-scale structure of the Universe. As light travels from distant galaxies to us, it is deflected by the intervening distribution of dark matter, imprinting tiny but coherent shear patterns on the sky. By measuring these distortions statistically across hundreds of millions of galaxies, we can map the underlying matter field, test models of cosmic acceleration, and constrain the physics that governs the growth of structure. Because the shear signal is extremely small, weak-lensing cosmology relies on precise shape measurements, accurate photometric redshifts, and a detailed understanding of observational and astrophysical systematics—areas in which my work is primarily focused within the Dark Energy Survey.



### DES Year 6: Weak Lensing Cosmology

The DES Year 6 (Y6) weak-lensing analysis represents the most precise measurement of cosmic shear ever produced by the collaboration. I contributed to the development, validation, and interpretation of the Y6 weak-lensing signal, focusing on ensuring that the measurement is robust against observational systematics, photometric uncertainties, and astrophysical effects such as intrinsic alignments. The Y6 dataset enables percent-level constraints on the large-scale structure of the Universe and plays a central role in DES cosmology.

### & Galaxy–Galaxy Lensing

I work on measurements and modeling of:

- Cosmic shear
- Galaxy–galaxy lensing
- Small-scale lensing signals and scale cuts
- Intrinsic alignments and systematics control

Much of this work has been developed within the **Dark Energy Survey (DES)**, particularly in the context of the Year 6 (Y6) analysis.

Galaxy–galaxy lensing (GGL) links the shapes of background galaxies to the positions of foreground galaxies, providing a direct probe of the connection between galaxies and dark matter. In DES Y6, I led the measurement, validation, and systematics program for the GGL signal across multiple lens samples and tomographic bins. This included extensive tests of shear calibration, redshift uncertainties, small-scale behaviour, and scale cuts. The resulting Y6 GGL dataset is the most precise produced by DES and is a key ingredient in the final multi-probe cosmological constraints.

### Photometric Redshifts and Calibration

I have led efforts in:

- Calibrating photometric redshift distributions for cosmological analyses
- Characterizing uncertainties from spectroscopic and deep photometric samples
- Developing and validating SOM-based methods (SOMPZ) and related techniques
- Studying spatial and sample-dependent systematics

For DES Y6, I led the development and validation of the SOMPZ redshift calibration for the *lens samples*. This effort extends the deep-field Self-Organizing Map Photometric Redshift method to lens galaxies for the first time in DES. The method maps galaxies in colour–magnitude space, uses deep fields to infer their redshift distribution, and propagates all sources of uncertainty through to the final cosmology analysis. This calibration is crucial because galaxy–galaxy lensing and galaxy clustering measurements depend sensitively on the lens redshift distribution.

In DES Y3, I led the calibration of the *lens* galaxy samples through a hybrid method combining SOMPZ deep-field mapping with clustering-based redshifts (wz). This allowed us to build high-precision redshift distributions for the different MagLim lens bins and to propagate their uncertainties into cosmological inference. I also quantified the impact of redshift mis-calibration on galaxy–galaxy lensing and galaxy clustering cosmology, ensuring consistency across probes and demonstrating the robustness of DES results.

In DES Year 3, I co-led the calibration of source redshift distributions using clustering redshifts ("wz"). This approach cross-correlates the photometric source sample with spectroscopic galaxies to infer the underlying redshift distribution. I developed and validated the methodology, studied its sensitivity to galaxy bias, magnification, and sample variation, and combined it with SOMPZ-based deep-field estimates. This hybrid calibration was essential to the Y3 cosmic shear and galaxy–galaxy lensing cosmology analyses.
