My research focuses on extracting robust cosmological information from galaxy surveys, with a particular emphasis on weak gravitational lensing, galaxy–galaxy lensing, and the calibration of photometric redshift distributions. I work primarily within the Dark Energy Survey (DES), developing the methods that connect imaging data to precise cosmological measurements. My contributions span the full inference pipeline: from photometric redshift calibration (using clustering-based methods, deep-field SOMPZ, and hybrid approaches) to the validation of weak-lensing and galaxy–galaxy lensing measurements, and finally to their impact on cosmological parameters. My work aims to ensure that the cosmological conclusions drawn from DES are both statistically optimal and systematically reliable.

## Main Themes

### Weak Lensing 


## DES Year 6: Weak Lensing Cosmology

The DES Year 6 (Y6) weak-lensing analysis represents the most precise measurement of cosmic shear ever produced by the collaboration. I contributed to the development, validation, and interpretation of the Y6 weak-lensing signal, focusing on ensuring that the measurement is robust against observational systematics, photometric uncertainties, and astrophysical effects such as intrinsic alignments. The Y6 dataset enables percent-level constraints on the large-scale structure of the Universe and plays a central role in DES cosmology.

### & Galaxy–Galaxy Lensing

I work on measurements and modeling of:

- Cosmic shear
- Galaxy–galaxy lensing
- Small-scale lensing signals and scale cuts
- Intrinsic alignments and systematics control

Much of this work has been developed within the **Dark Energy Survey (DES)**, particularly in the context of the Year 6 (Y6) analysis.

### Photometric Redshifts and Calibration

I have led efforts in:

- Calibrating photometric redshift distributions for cosmological analyses
- Characterizing uncertainties from spectroscopic and deep photometric samples
- Developing and validating SOM-based methods (SOMPZ) and related techniques
- Studying spatial and sample-dependent systematics
