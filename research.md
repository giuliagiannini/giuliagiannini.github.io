My work focuses on using weak gravitational lensing and related probes to study the large-scale structure of the Universe and constrain cosmological models, with particular emphasis on systematics and robust inference.

## Main Themes

### Weak Lensing & Galaxy–Galaxy Lensing

I work on measurements and modeling of:

- Cosmic shear
- Galaxy–galaxy lensing
- Small-scale lensing signals and scale cuts
- Intrinsic alignments and systematics control

Much of this work has been developed within the **Dark Energy Survey (DES)**, particularly in the context of the Year 6 (Y6) analysis.

### Photometric Redshifts and Calibration

I have led efforts in:

- Calibrating photometric redshift distributions for cosmological analyses
- Characterizing uncertainties from spectroscopic and deep photometric samples
- Developing and validating SOM-based methods (SOMPZ) and related techniques
- Studying spatial and sample-dependent systematics

### Multi-Probe Cosmology

I am interested in combining:

- Weak lensing
- Galaxy clustering
- CMB lensing
- tSZ (thermal Sunyaev–Zel’dovich effect)

using both traditional summary statistics and simulation-based inference to improve cosmological constraints and robustness.

### Simulation-Based Inference (SBI)

I contribute to the development and application of SBI methods for cosmology, including:

- Neural density estimators applied to forward-modeled data vectors
- Joint analyses of multiple probes
- Validation against traditional likelihood-based pipelines
