        <p>
        I am a cosmologist working on the large-scale structure of the Universe, with a particular focus on weak gravitational lensing and galaxy–galaxy lensing. Broadly, I am interested in how we can extract robust cosmological information from increasingly complex data, and in understanding where our measurements are most vulnerable to observational and modeling systematics.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        My research is motivated by a simple question: how confidently can we test models of dark energy with current and upcoming surveys? Much of my work therefore focuses on improving the robustness of weak-lensing analyses, with particular attention to redshift calibration and systematic uncertainties in photometric data.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        I am currently based at ICE–CSIC in Barcelona as a Juan de la Cierva Fellow. Over the past seven years, I have been deeply involved in the Dark Energy Survey (DES), contributing to lensing measurements and redshift calibration efforts, including work toward the Year 6 analysis. In parallel, I am an active member of LSST-DESC, where I contribute primarily as a photo-z expert, supporting methodological development and cross-collaboration efforts.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        More recently, I joined the Euclid Collaboration, where I am extending this work to 3×2pt analyses and related projects, building on my experience from DES and LSST-DESC. Across these collaborations, my broader goal is to understand how observational choices and modeling assumptions propagate into cosmological constraints, and to help develop analysis strategies that enable reliable tests of dark energy with current and future surveys.
