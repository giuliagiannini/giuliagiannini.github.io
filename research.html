      <h1>Research</h1>
      <p>
        My research focuses on extracting robust cosmological information from galaxy surveys, with a particular emphasis on weak gravitational lensing, galaxy–galaxy lensing, and the calibration of photometric redshift distributions. I work primarily within the Dark Energy Survey (DES), developing the methods that connect imaging data to precise cosmological measurements. My contributions span the full inference pipeline: from photometric redshift calibration (using clustering-based methods, deep-field SOMPZ, and hybrid approaches) to the validation of weak-lensing and galaxy–galaxy lensing measurements, and finally to their impact on cosmological parameters. My work aims to ensure that the cosmological conclusions drawn from DES are both statistically optimal and systematically reliable. I contributed extensively to DES both during the Year 3 analysis (published in 2022) and the final, Year 6 analysis (published in 2026).       </p>
      <h2>Weak Lensing</h2>
               
      Weak gravitational lensing is the subtle distortion of galaxy shapes caused by the gravitational field of the large-scale structure of the Universe. As light travels from distant galaxies to us, it is deflected by the intervening distribution of dark matter, imprinting tiny but coherent shear patterns on the sky. By measuring these distortions statistically across hundreds of millions of galaxies, we can map the underlying matter field, test models of cosmic acceleration, and constrain the physics that governs the growth of structure. Because the shear signal is extremely small, weak-lensing cosmology relies on precise shape measurements, accurate photometric redshifts, and a detailed understanding of observational and astrophysical systematics—areas in which my work is primarily focused within the Dark Energy Survey.

            <h2>DES Year 6: Weak Lensing Cosmology</h2>
            <p>
                The DES Year 6 (Y6) weak-lensing analysis represents the most precise measurement of cosmic shear ever produced by the collaboration. I contributed to the development, validation, and interpretation of the Y6 weak-lensing signal, focusing on ensuring that the measurement is robust against observational systematics, photometric uncertainties, and astrophysical effects such as intrinsic alignments. The Y6 dataset enables percent-level constraints on the large-scale structure of the Universe and plays a central role in DES cosmology.

            <h2>Photometric redshift calibration (SOMPZ)</h2>
            <p>
Large imaging surveys like DES observe hundreds of millions of galaxies, but their distances cannot be measured directly for each object. Instead, distances are estimated from galaxy colours using photometric redshifts, which must be carefully calibrated to avoid biases in cosmological results. My work focuses on developing and validating methods to accurately determine the redshift distributions of galaxy samples used for cosmology. This includes using information from deep survey regions and from galaxy clustering to statistically infer where galaxies lie along the line of sight. These calibration techniques were applied in DES Year 3 and further extended in Year 6, ensuring that weak-lensing and galaxy–galaxy lensing measurements lead to robust and reliable cosmological conclusions.

I have led efforts in:
- Calibrating photometric redshift distributions for cosmological analyses
- Characterizing uncertainties from spectroscopic and deep photometric samples
- Developing and validating SOM-based methods (SOMPZ) and related techniques
- Studying spatial and sample-dependent systematics

For DES Y6, I led the development and validation of a photometric-based method called SOMPZ (Self-Organizing Map Photometric Redshift) to calibrate the redshift for the *lens samples*. The method maps galaxies in colour–magnitude space, uses deep fields to infer their redshift distribution, and propagates all sources of uncertainty through to the final cosmology analysis. This calibration is crucial because galaxy–galaxy lensing and galaxy clustering measurements depend sensitively on the lens redshift distribution.            </p>
