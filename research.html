      <h1>Research</h1>
      <p>
        My research focuses on using large galaxy surveys to understand how the Universe is structured and how it has evolved over time. I work mainly with data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES), where I develop and validate methods that turn imaging observations of galaxies into precise cosmological measurements. My work spans several stages of the analysis process, from estimating galaxy distances to testing and interpreting gravitational lensing signals. A central goal of my research is to ensure that cosmological results are both accurate and robust against observational uncertainties. I contributed extensively to the DES Year 3 analysis (published in 2022) and to the final DES Year 6 analysis (published in 2026).
      <h2>Weak Lensing</h2>
               
          Weak gravitational lensing refers to the tiny distortions in the shapes of distant galaxies caused by the matter distributed between them and the observer. Although these distortions are very small, they carry valuable information about the distribution of dark matter and the evolution of cosmic structure. By measuring these effects statistically across millions of galaxies, we can test models of cosmic acceleration and the growth of structure. My work in this area focuses on ensuring that weak-lensing measurements are accurate and well understood, particularly with respect to observational effects and uncertainties in galaxy distances.

            <h2>DES Year 6: Weak Lensing Cosmology</h2>
            <p>
The DES Year 6 (Y6) weak-lensing analysis is the most precise cosmic shear measurement produced by the collaboration. I contributed to the development and validation of this analysis, with a focus on testing the measurement against observational effects and uncertainties in galaxy properties. The Y6 dataset provides some of the strongest constraints from DES on the large-scale structure of the Universe and plays a key role in the final cosmological results.

            <h2>DES Year 6: Galaxy-galaxy lensing</h2>
            <p>
Galaxy–galaxy lensing measures how foreground galaxies distort the shapes of background galaxies, providing a direct link between visible galaxies and the underlying dark matter. In DES Year 6, I led the measurement and validation of this signal across multiple galaxy samples and redshift ranges. This work included extensive testing of measurement stability and uncertainty estimates. The resulting dataset is the most precise galaxy–galaxy lensing measurement from DES and is an essential component of its combined cosmological analyses.

         <h2>Photometric redshift calibration</h2>

Large imaging surveys such as DES observe hundreds of millions of galaxies, but their distances cannot be measured individually using spectroscopy. Instead, distances are estimated from galaxy colours, and these estimates must be carefully calibrated to avoid biases in cosmological results. My research focuses on developing and validating methods to determine reliable distance distributions for galaxy samples used in cosmology. This work combines information from deep survey fields and from the spatial clustering of galaxies, and it has been applied to both DES Year 3 and Year 6 analyses.

            <h2>Photometric redshift calibration (SOMPZ)</h2>
            <p>
For DES Year 6, I led the development and validation of a method known as SOMPZ (Self-Organizing Map Photometric Redshift) to calibrate the distances of lens galaxies. The approach groups galaxies with similar observed properties and uses deeper data to infer their distance distributions. This calibration is essential for interpreting galaxy–galaxy lensing and galaxy clustering measurements and for ensuring reliable cosmological results.

            <h2>Photometric redshift calibration (SOMPZ)</h2>
            <p>
In DES Year 3, I led the calibration of lens galaxy samples using a hybrid approach that combined deep-field information with clustering-based methods. This work produced precise distance distributions for the DES lens samples and allowed their uncertainties to be consistently propagated into cosmological analyses. The success of this approach established it as the reference method for subsequent DES studies.

            <h2>Photometric redshift calibration (SOMPZ)</h2>
            <p>
In DES Year 3, I co-led the calibration of source galaxy distances using clustering redshifts. This method infers distance distributions by comparing the spatial distribution of photometric galaxies with that of spectroscopic samples. I contributed to developing and validating the methodology and to combining it with deep-field information, making it a key component of the DES weak-lensing and galaxy–galaxy lensing analyses.
